Following the Mozilla Tutorial, increasing my abilities with the canvas element, as well as Event Listeners and manipulating the DOM. 
Next goals:-
  -Increasing the speed of the ball upon hitting an edge/brick.
  -Implementing 'Levels'
  -Implementing a pause at the start of the game and when losing a life.
  -Game to start again with the ball on the paddle, with spacebar launching the ball.
  -Changing the direction of the ball depending on what position on the paddle the ball collides with.
